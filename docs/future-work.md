title: Future Work
---

1. **More accessible**: As soon as Charming can run in modern browsers, there will be a online playground to try it online and may be a platform to create, sharing Charming sketches with others like [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/).
2. **Tests and Bug Fix**: There may be some bugs because Charming have just been simply tested, so one of future works is to test and fix bugs.
3. **Improve Performance**: Now both of the frontend and the backend of Charming are implemented in Python, there's a plan to rewrite backend in Rust or C++ and refactor some rendering algorithms such as polygon filling to achieve a better performance.
4. **API Enhancement**: Add more cool APIs according to the feature of terminal and character.
5. **More Examples**: Write more interesting examplesï¼š
   1. ascii art animation
   2. character-style generative art
   3. terminal game
   4. expressive data visualization
6. **Better Documentation**: Write usages, parameters, returns, examples for each API.
